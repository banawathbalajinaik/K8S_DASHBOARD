## Following are the instructions to Install Kubectl Version V1.14.9, Minikube Version V1.6.2 and Kubernetes Version V1.14.0
## on Windows Desktop with at least two cores

### Oracle VirtualBox ver 5.2.6 is a pre-requisite for these and please install it in case it is missing

1. Download Kubectl Version V1.14.9 from location -> https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.14.9/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe
2. Copy it to any location on your system (say C:\Kubectl) and append this to the System PATH (Environment Variable -> Edit Path -> Append)


3. Download Minikube Version V1.6.2 -> https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.6.2
4. Unzip it to any folder and install it to C:\Minikube folder
5. Ensure System PATH environment variable has C:\Minikube set, append it in case it is missing
6. Add a new ENVIRONMENT Variable called - MINIKUBE_HOME and point it to C:\Minikube folder

7. Open a command prompt, preferably with 'Administrative' permissions, in any folder and type in:

>minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox --kubernetes-version v1.14.0

It will take a while for Virtual Box to spin up your Minikube and after the command prompt shows up, type in:

>kubectl version
>kubectl cluster-info

That's it, your have successfully set up Minikube to run Kubernetes V 1.14!!

# If needed, put down the following in a bat file - start.bat and you can run this to start your K8s Cluster

minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox --kubernetes-version v1.14.0
